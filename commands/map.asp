  <p><h1>SUBALTERN EAT FRESH:<br><small><small><small>Mapping the Representation and Consumption of
Subaltern Societies in <i>VICE</i> Media</small></small></small></h1><p>    When one thinks of the worldwide web, it is often associated with the idea of being a ‘global village’ where people of all genders, races, and classes can come together and leave their prejudices behind to exist in relative harmony. Although the Internet as we know it today has evolved into a space for freedom of expression, not everyone is offered fair and equal representation. Some populations, particularly those on the periphery of society and the third world, have limited access to the Internet. As a result of this, they also lack any means of communicating their narratives to the rest of the world. This has led to the proliferation of several digital news media outlets, which aggregate a multitude of stories for daily consumption. The rate at which these stories are being disseminated can often lead to the production of harmful, single story narratives that are poor in quality and lack significant context. The proliferation of such digital media has contributed to the erasure and loss of subjectivity of those who live in subaltern societies. Thus, it is important to note how neocolonialism functions in the workings of digital news media outlets such as VICE, with a specific focus on their role as a transnational journalism network.</p><figure><img src="https://unilogue.github.io/images/cast.PNG"></figure><p><small>     ↳ The cast &amp; screw of VICE's HBO television show. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/vice/cast-and-crew/index.html">(source)</a></small></p>
<p>    First, it is important to establish the origins of VICE media. The company started out as a government-funded punk magazine and welfare program called the <i>Voice of Montreal</i>, founded by Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi and Gavin McInnes in Quebec, Canada in 1994 (Flashes and Flames). The creators soon bought out the franchise, changed its name to VICE in 1996 and relocated to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY in 2001. <div id="world"><script src="https://unilogue.github.io/js/map1.js"></script></div><br><p><small>Created with <a href="https://github.com/unilogue/datamaps">datamaps.</a> A majority of Vice's viewers are from core countries, or the first world. The transparent countries mostly consist of peripheral countries, or the third world. Lighter shades indicate more viewership while darker indicates less. The U.S.A. makes up the most at 36.2%.</small></p></div> They began to reinvent the franchise as an American-based liberal news and lifestyle brand, and expanded from print to video with the launch of their first Youtube channel in 2006. While their content mirrors the minorities who once lived in their gentrified headquarters, the demographics of VICE’s audience reflect the people who are living there today. According to Alexa.com, a majority of VICE’s audience is male, under 30, and college educated. Despite being known for having a global following, North America and Europe constitute over 75% of the traffic to their website (Alexa).</p><p>Pew Research has found several key facts in VICE’s development: the company has been rapidly expanding both its news operations and its focus on video through an HBO show and licensing deals with other TV networks, averaging 77 million monthly video views; in February, the company launched a news portal on its website that includes 50 posts a day in various formats, including live streaming and edited video. They have also been in the process of hiring young producers who were “capturing and covering news stories in an immersive documentary style that resonates with [their] audience” (Olmstead et al).</p><p>    In another interview, CEO Shane Smith states that on a cable news network, stories emerging from countries such as South Sudan would get a “three-minute clip with no context or background” and that “because [it] is on the internet, [VICE] can expand the story,” as they are not limited by run times. He goes on to say: “I think there’s an appetite there for knowledge so why not feed it” (Riordian). VICE has made it their mission to provide news for a young generation that doesn’t watch television. Figures have shown that across most developed economies, television-watching among millennials is decreasing while digital news consumption is on the rise (Flashes and Flames). Old media and legacy news outlets have caught on to VICE’s burgeoning young demographic of millennials, and some have even made investments in the company, one of them being Rupert Murdoch, the owner of 20th Century Fox News. In August 2013, he invested a reported 5% stake in VICE media at $70 million. In a tweet, Murdoch wrote: “Who’s heard of VICE Media? Wild, interesting effort to interest millennials who don’t read or watch established media. Global Success.”<br><br>This was a strange yet sensible move for Murdoch. His news channel Fox News is often accused of making biased, conservative reporting that promotes xenophobia and racism, among other prejudices. VICE on the other hand, apparently offers a more liberal and tolerant perspective. Perhaps it can be said that Murdoch invested in VICE knowing that these two outlets contradicted each other, yet they almost complement each other in terms of covering all market demographics. After all, sensationalism has been proven to be more remunerative than real news. Here are several of VICE’s online manifests:</p><blockquote><div><b>Site description:</b> “VICE.com is an ever-expanding nebula of immersive investigative journalism, uncomfortable sociological examination, uncouth activities, making fun of people who should know better, and award-winning documentaries from a worldwide network of contributors.”<br><br><b>VICE News Youtube description:</b> “VICE News is an international news channel created by and for a connected generation. Our documentaries and original news series bring you an unvarnished look at some of the most important events of our time, and shine a light on underreported stories around the globe.”<br><br><b>VICE Youtube description:</b> “VICE specializes in exploring uncomfortable truths and going to places we don’t belong. Herein you will find people talking frankly about their hatred and love for various things, general heresy, the only culture, travel and news documentaries you’ll want to watch, tons of exclusive new stuff, and probably not a lot of cats. You’re welcome.”</div></blockquote><p>    How has VICE managed to become a transnational journalism network? In the founders own words: “The only company that was forward thinking enough to say we’re going to do a small minority investment, but give you the help you need to get into India for example or Europe, South-East Asia, or South America was 21st Century Fox” (Riordian). However, they have not made an effort to hire local journalists for each of the headquarters that they’ve set up.</p><figure><img src="https://unilogue.github.io/images/masthead.png"></figure><p>On their site’s masthead, some headquarters correspond to specific cities, such as New York and Los Angeles, while others correspond to entire countries, including Mexico, Russia, and Brazil (VICE). How far reaching can their work be and what kind of quality can one expect if their staff is spread out so narrowly? What does this mean for local journalists who are already covering stories on their own countries? As one study states: “Vice magazine is distributed as a print format at over 16,000 selected lifestyle venues in urban markets world-wide. Each international edition of Vice magazine is tailor-made for its community but it also features content which is shared between all territories” (Colacurcio). What does it say that VICE is distributed in ‘urban’ markets worldwide? Urban centers and metropoles are often the site of capitalist hegemony, and they enact violence on the periphery of the state. This is the exact violence which VICE seeks to shed a light on, yet their content is relegated to ‘lifestyle venues’ and made for the cavalier consumption of the upper class. Critics have pointed out the harm that this does to a society:</p><blockquote><div>“Certain people or groups of people are more influential in defining reality that others. In any modern society, where socioeconomic classes, ethnic and religious groups, age groups, and political interests struggle for control over resources, there is also a struggle for the power to determine or influence that society’s conception of reality (Gans, 1971). Those who emerge successful gain control over information, define values, create myths, manipulate events, and influence what the rest of us take for granted. Conflict theorists therefore argue that people with more power, prestige, status, wealth, and access to high-level policymakers can turn their perceptions of the world into the entire culture’s perception” (Newman).</div></blockquote><p>    The producers at VICE have contributed to the phenomenon of media globalization through their transnational journalism network. Because technology has connected the world at a larger scale, it has also facilitated the dissemination of media and made the world relatively smaller. Researchers point out that “all the world can learn about world events is what New York, London, or Paris chooses to tell them” (Eijaz et al). This obviously applies to VICE as they are based out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Although the Internet has allowed people to create their own content, only the upper socio-economic class is empowered enough to do so. On a global scale, there is a stark digital divide between the global North and South. For example, 81% of developed countries have Internet access, compared to only 34% of developing countries (ICT). The fact that VICE’s content is made in English and marketed to young white male millennials is an obvious sign that they do not serve the subaltern societies that they document. The digital humanities professor Lisa Nakamura has done phenomenal work on the visual cultures of the Internet. In her seminal work <i>Cybertypes</i>, she outlines the relationship between Internet users in the West and subaltern societies around the world. She makes the distinction that the web does not exist as a place where people passively roam, but as a space to be “traversed and colonized in a ship.” Cybernetic tourism functions in much the same way as it does in real life, as users in the West, and those who watch VICE in particular, operate from a position of privilege and entitlement to the consumption of those of ‘lower’ status. The content that VICE produces on the “third world” and “primitive” places and people, reinforces the dichotomy between the ‘civilized’ Western observer and the ‘savage’ of the global South/oriental sphere. She defines cybertypes in several ways:</p><blockquote><div>(a) “Cybertype is taken from the word stereotype which was a ‘mechanical device that could reproduce images relatively cheaply, quickly, and in mass quantities.’”<br> (b) “Cybertypes are the images of race that arise when the fears, anxieties, and desires of privileged Western users (the majority of Internet users and content producers are still from the Western nations) are scripted into a textual/graphical environment that is in constant flux and revision.”</div></blockquote><p>Citing the theorist Rey Chow, she states that “images of raced others become necessary symptoms of the postcolonial condition” and that “we see that in our fascination with the ‘authentic native’ we are actually engaged in a search for the aura even while our search processes themselves take us farther and farther from that ‘original’ point of identification.” This idea of the search for an original and ‘authentic’ object can be traced back to “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” by Walter Benjamin. In this work, Benjamin states that “technology had radically changed the nature of art by making it possible to reproduce infinite copies of it—thus devaluing the ‘aura’ of the original.” Chow acknowledges that the native has his own aura, and that when natives deviate from the stereotypes placed on them, they are no longer “authentic” (Nakamura). VICE has certainly prided itself on showing its audience instances where the subaltern breaks its stereotype, however they are only interested in deviations that align with or contribute to American counterculture, such as punk rock, drug use, and MOGAI communities. Hence, these reproducible realities destroy the uniqueness of subaltern societies. By “honoring” the diversity of these societies, they are erasing any differences that existed between them. The following quote from bell hooks’ <i>Eating the Other</i> highlights how VICE has erased the narratives of the people that they document:</p><blockquote><div>“Currently, the commodification of difference promotes paradigms of consumption wherein whatever difference the Other inhabits is eradicated, via exchange, by a consumer cannibalism that not only displaces the Other but denies the significance of that Other’s history through a process of decontextualization […] In mass culture, imperialist nostalgia takes the form of reenacting and reritualizing in different ways the imperialist, colonizing journey as narrative fantasy of power and desire, of seduction by the Other. This longing is rooted in the atavistic belief that the spirit of the “primitive” resides in the bodies of dark Others whose cultures, traditions, and lifestyles may indeed be irrevocably changed by imperialism, colonization, and racist domination. The desire to make contact with those bodies deemed Other, with no apparent will to dominate, assuages the guilt of the past, even takes the form of a deﬁant gesture where one denies accountability and historical connection.”</div></blockquote><p>In this sense, the colonizing journey is manifested through VICE’s transnational journalism network, and its effort to document these societies appeases the trauma that colonial powers such as America and Europe have made. Since the late 90s, multiculturalism has erupted onto Western psyche, from school curriculums to television shows and news outlets such as VICE. This has proliferated a new generation, post Generation X, which Nakamura calls Generation D. Technology has the effect of stripping this digerati generation of culture and country, replacing national and racial identity with a purely corporate identity, or the VICE ethos. Through this framework, VICE’s correspondents exist as mediators of knowledge to the young white liberal male cosmopolitan millennial, or in a shorter term: the hipster. bell hooks further explains the construct of this new social identity:</p><blockquote><div>“Whereas mournful imperialist nostalgia constitutes the betrayed and abandoned world of the Other as an accumulation of lack and loss, contemporary longing for the “primitive” is expressed by the projection onto the Other of a sense of plenty, bounty, a field of dreams. […] Masses of young people dissatisfied by U.S. imperialism, unemployment, lack of economic opportunity, afflicted by the postmodern malaise of alienation, no sense of grounding, no redemptive identity, can be manipulated by cultural strategies that offer Otherness as appeasement, particularly through commodification. The contemporary crises of identity in the west, especially as experienced by white youth, are eased when the “primitive” is recouped via a focus on diversity and pluralism which suggests the Other can provide life-sustaining alternatives. Concurrently, diverse ethnic/racial groups can also embrace this sense of specialness, that histories and experience once seen as worthy only of disdain can be looked upon with awe.”</div></blockquote><p>Here, hooks states that disillusioned hipsters who feel that society has failed them can look to subaltern societies for a nostalgia of what life should be like, or at least feel grateful in knowing that they could be in that position and things could be worse. Nakamura furthers this notion by stating that “the Internet must contain images of authentic natives in the service of militating against particular images of cultural hybridity. The Internet functions as a tourism machine; it reproduces digital images of race as other.” This promotes a sort of xenophilia, or attraction to foreign people, while still being detached and not actually producing a hybrid of cultures.</p><p>     Perhaps the only real hybrids that exists in VICE’s context are their co-founder Suroosh Alvi and the consultant of their VICE TV series, Fareed Zakaria. Both are of Indian descent, and are some of the only people of color among VICE’s mostly white male staff, yet they can be read as white in the context of the company’s image. Nakamura applies this to South Asian programmers, who are often associated with making up a large portion of the tech industry:</p><blockquote><div>“Here, Gajjala posits that “privileged hybrid transnational subjects” such as Clark's coveted South Asian programmers can be read, for all intents and purposes, as “white” since they participate in the “cultural hegemony that privileges a white race.” While they are no doubt part of that hegemony, as is every person of color who consumes, produces, and becomes the object of representation of information technologies, I contend that they are put to work in that hegemony in distinctively raced ways. The “work” that they do in this hegemony, their value-added labor in the system of information practices dubbed “global capitalism,” is this: their cybertypes work to preserve taxonomies of racial difference.”</div></blockquote><p>Zakaria serves as the hybrid between the impoverished third world native and the immigrant who has settled in the neoliberal developing world and ‘made’ something of himself. Though he may be a personable and welcoming face, VICE’s audience doesn’t wish to see people who are on an equal level as them. Citing Trinh Minh-ha, Nakamura notes: “[…] even very sophisticated tourists are quick to reject experiences that challenge their received notions of authentic otherness. Minh-ha writes, ‘The Third World representative the modern sophisticated public ideally seeks is the unspoiled African, Asian, or Native American, who remains more preoccupied with his/her image as the real native— the truly different— than with the issues of hegemony, feminism, and social change.’”. As tourist consumers, VICE’s audience would rather see the ‘real’ native who is unassimilated and unspoiled by technology and wealth. The VICE Staff published a message to their audience detailing what to expect from the show:</p><blockquote><div>“Essentially, the show will be what we do best: a variety of mind-melting stories from around the globe and immersive detours into the scariest, most absurd, and flat-out unbelievable cultures and situations around the globe. Here are a few ideas we're spitballing right now: a portrait of child Taliban suicide bombers, visiting underground voodoo heroin clinics in New York, riding along with Somalian pirates, and booking a teeth cleaning with a Satanic dentist in the Pacific Northwest.”</div></blockquote><p>Here, the VICE Staff lists various peoples and cultures as commodities for consumption.  I would contend that VICE wasn’t simply given a show, but that they were deployed with a specific purpose for the neoliberal project, which is the erasure of subaltern subjectivities and Western accountability. What’s worse is the juxtaposition of voodoo, pirates, and suicide bombers—which emerged in response to colonialism, capitalism, and slavery—with demonic and satanic imagery. What follows in the documentaries that I will be discussing serve as a testament to VICE’s co-opting and erasing practices.</p><p>    Postcolonial theory studies subaltern societies, which are peoples who exist outside of dominant power structures. In the context of cultural hegemony, subaltern theorists such as Gayatri Spivak would claim that the West predominately shapes our knowledge of the world. The foundation of colonialism rests on the dichotomy of the ‘civilized’ Occident (West) and the ‘backwards’ Orient (East or Other). This has been reinforced through the early explorations of the Orient, as European travelers returned with reports of strange, savage lands. By portraying the Orient as uncivilized, the West could justify colonizing the Orient; thus, the subjectivity of the subaltern was not sought out. The tradition of Eurocentric Orientalism has continued in discourse and mass media throughout the ages. Today, it is used to gauge the synchrony between the Orient and the Western world. Subaltern societies are judged by their adoption of several neoliberal policies including capitalist democracy and state-sanctioned rights. As a transnational journalism network, VICE functions as a neocolonial force which surveils subaltern societies, not only to distinguish them from the West but also to measure their level of modernization.</p><p>    The book <i>Consuming the Caribbean: From Arawaks to Zombies</i> by Mimi Sheller offers a comprehensive framework for mapping the ways in which VICE’s documentaries of various Caribbean islands perpetuate an Orientalist narrative. Although the author is a white woman with no personal ties to the Caribbean, she recognizes her position as an outsider who has consumed the Caribbean as a tourist, cultural consumer, and academic. Sheller notes that “the mobilities of consumption are not only material, but also cultural and discursive.” Thus, VICE’s audience not only consumes the material commodities of the Caribbean—such as cannabis, oil, and sugar—but through VICE’s documentaries they are able to consume the people and processes behind them. For centuries, the Caribbean has been a literal virtual world which one could escape to for a sense of relaxation and tropical paradise. However, the Orientalist myth of African barbarism was transported through the transatlantic slave trade. As a result, in recent years, tourists and ethnographers have gone in search of this.</p><figure data-provider="youtube" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcXcjioLLvRQ"><iframe id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXcjioLLvRQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>VICE’s documentary “Investigating the Haitian Zombie” features a twenty-something white male on a quest to find a live Haitian zombie. The documentary is divided into two main types of sequences: one in which the consultant visits a white ethnobiologist to discuss the potion that creates zombies; and another in which the consultant combs Haitian villages in search of zombies and to participate in their ‘voodoo’ rituals. The consultant is both perplexed, amazed, and disgusted by the Haitian’s customs. When he is invited to a sacred sacrifice ritual, he is unscathed by the Haitian’s mysticism, as it has no effect on him. However, when he and several Haitian men attempt to summon a zombie, the Haitian’s must perform the role of the savage in order to amuse VICE’s audience. This documentary makes little to no attempt to discuss the history of the zombie. The myth of the zombie arose from the living-dead status of Haitian slaves, who only existed to provide forced expropriated labor for French colonizers. This was soon uprooted by Hollywood to depict monsters that ate young children and dug up corpses for rituals. Sheller offers a different take on what it means to be a cannibal:</p><blockquote><div>“What does it mean to eat another? If slaves were not literally eaten (though perhaps some may have been), then in what sense was their 'blood' feeding the flow of commodity capitalism? […] Recent human rights campaigns have highlighted how poor people in disadvantaged countries have been used unethically by foreign medical and research institutions, often with state support. Do these bodily relations constitute a new form of cannibalism? In an odd twist on the history of slavery as a kind of cannibalism, poor populations in some Caribbean countries have literally had their blood sucked and their bodies cut up 'for science'” (Sheller).</div></blockquote><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuLNIX_iki0A"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLNIX_iki0A?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>        In VICE’s documentary “Caribbean Fashion Week: Dancehall &amp; Skin Bleaching”, a young white European woman is deployed to investigate the dancehall subculture in Jamaica, as well as its ties to the practice of skin bleaching. This is a literal reenactment of the surveillance of Black women’s bodies from the early colonial era. Skin bleaching arose as a result of the enforcement of European standards of beauty on the colony’s populace. Although people of affluence bleach their skin, it is especially popular in low income areas. The documentary notes that many of these women wish to look like the American pop artist Nicki Minaj, who is considered a ‘black Barbie’ because of her light skin and curves. The irony of this documentary is that the consultant serves as the ideal image of womanhood, yet she makes observations about the “unnatural paleness” of the Jamaican women’s bodies. She films the inside of the women’s homes, condescendingly remarking in a voice-over that they were consuming arsenic and chicken feed for curvier bodies, and the pills that they were taking to grow curvier bodies were actually anti-depression pills for cats. She even goes as far as following around a female sex worker, filming the intimate process of a Jamaican woman bleaching her skin and even trying some herself. The sex worker tells her that for a Black woman, lightening her skin lifts her up and gets her out of the ghetto, as men in strip clubs would be more likely to pick you and pamper you; especially men of different races. Sheller discusses the function of sex tourism in Jamaica:<br></p><blockquote><div>“The sexualisation of young 'exotic' bodies, male and female, has become a standard tool of Caribbean tourist promotion, from hotel brochures to magazine advertising and guidebooks. Certain regions even specialise in the selling of particular kinds of bodies, from the dark-skinned 'African' rent-a-dread in Jamaica to the 'hybrid' light brown mulatta woman in the Dominican Republic or Cuba (Sánchez Taylor 1999). As Jacqueline Sánchez Taylor has shown, sex tourism packages Caribbean people as 'embodied commodities' by turning the long history of sexual exploitation of women (and men) under colonial rule into a 'lived colonial fantasy' available for the mass tourist consumer […] The forms of 'chocolate' these sex workers embody underlines their commodity status as tropical pleasures produced for Euro-American markets” (ibid).</div></blockquote><p>She goes on to say that tourists can vicariously consume Caribbean sexuality through Dancehall. VICE is not the first Western outlet to cover this past time, as the British channel BBC has shown specials on the sexual antics of tourists on vacation in Jamaica. She notes that these depictions of Caribbean culture have depended significantly on constructing Black sexuality and gender relations as being wild and uncontrolled; yet at the same time, this construct of primitive 'black' sexuality serves the needs of the national tourism and music industries. The policing of sex workers and MOGAI individuals is thus meant to maintain the national 'body' in the neocolonial Caribbean. Under this paradigm, Caribbean men and women are socialized to be citizens in service of the heterosexual desires of tourists.</p><figure data-provider="youtube" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DILXVpFQVEbw"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILXVpFQVEbw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>    This ties into another documentary by VICE titled “Young and Gay: Jamaica’s Gully Queens”. VICE is known for covering the MOGAI communities of various countries, including Iran and Indonesia. Many would believe that the goal of this coverage is to shine a light on the struggles that MOGAI individuals face, however, I would contend that their coverage perpetuates homonationalism. This is a term coined by Ph.D. Jasbir Puar, which she defines as “an exceptional form of national homonormativity,” (i.e. cisgender white male homosexuality) which subaltern societies should align with. This paradigm rests on the foundation of secular queerness and the Orientalist myth that the homophobia of religious and racial communities outweighs the racism of white communities (Puar). This marks the Other as too intolerant for inclusion and justifies the colonization of subaltern sexual minorities. VICE replicates this neocolonialism by depicting Jamaican society as backwards—not for their inherent primitive sexuality as previously condemned and exploited, but for conforming to the systems set in place by those very colonial powers. </p><figure data-provider="youtube" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXV5K8GpNRZo%26list%3DPLw613M86o5o5pFOUNCgv68v6ljH_7uM3e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5K8GpNRZo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>    A similar kind of demonization of Caribbean people occurs in the documentary “Jamaican Bud Business.” The island of Jamaica is often associated with cannabis, Rastafarianism, and reggae. VICE’s audience, which presumably consists of drug users, are able to see the country that their drugs are manufactured, as well as the obstacles that these people face. The documentary revolves around the fact that cannabis has actually been illegal in Jamaica since colonial times, and blockades have been made to prevent smuggling. Many poor people on the countryside of Jamaica where this drug grows sell it to maintain their livelihoods, and they are often jailed if they’re caught selling or smoking it. This has not only hindered the practices of Rastafarians, who use it for medicinal and religious purposes, but some would argue that Jamaica is inhibiting itself from developing their economy. By legalizing the consumption and distribution of cannabis, Jamaica could become a developed country like the United States. In another fit of irony, VICE is now glorifying the legalization of drugs, not necessarily for the benefit of Jamaicans, but for their audience’s own recreational purposes. Sheller points out that in 1980s, the US-led War on Drugs enabled Jamaican police forces to terrorize civilians, and so many sought refuge in the United States. However, the immigration of Jamaicans to Europe and North America was associated with the migration of drugs and violence, as they acted out the globalized violence of Hollywood movies such as Scarface and the Godfather. The ‘contamination’ of white people is also present in their interest of reggae music, as Sheller notes:</p><blockquote><div>“Now that gunmen are bringing Jamaican-style executions to the streets of London, can we blame the new sound for inciting anarchy in the UK?' Barbara Browning has noted the use of the metaphor of 'infectious rhythm' to describe the ways in which African-Caribbean music gets into 'white' bodies, like a virus, thus connecting positive attitudes toward music with a more subtle negativity towards immigrants and the dangers they might carry with them (Browning 1998). Imagery of the Jamaican 'Yardie' gangster in Britain and the 'war on drugs' in North America exploits the image of the Caribbean as a lawless zone of disorder in need of global policing, legitimising greater external control over the movements of its 'infectious' people.”</div></blockquote><p>    When one looks at the visual aspect of VICE’s documentaries, it is obvious that these images echo colonial fantasies and are meant to militate feelings of voyeuristic disgust. This is evident in titles such as “The Cannibal Warlords of Liberia” and “The Biggest Ass in Brazil”. Psychologists have studied how negative, sensationalist headlines function as clickbait by drawing more attention, and thus more revenue (Scacco et al). This follows the long history of the sexualization and exotification of subaltern societies by colonial powers.</p><figure data-provider="youtube" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXasTcDsDfMg"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XasTcDsDfMg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>One scholar notes that in VICE’s Guide to Liberia, as with many of its documentaries, the film addresses the audience with the use of a reporter being on-screen and a voice over, or a ‘voice-of-authority’ (Kalvø). Although VICE markets itself as an immersive journalism outlet, the scholar notes that the rhetorical position the reporter situates himself in has an implicit Western bias, which at times can be interpreted as stigmatizing (ibid). In a central cut of the documentary on Liberia’s Ebola crisis, the reporter buys supposedly Ebola-infested monkey meat and gives it to his subjects. He is then quoted saying “Could we not splatter the monkey all over me, please. Oh, my god! I’m getting fucking pegged with Ebola monkey right now! I’m getting fragged with Ebola monkey!” as the two Liberian men are filmed eating the meat, almost scoffing at the reporter’s worries. The scene is juxtaposed with footage of a research lab where an American scientist discusses the virus. This is meant to portray the Liberians as backwards and disease-ridden savages. Other times, the documentary resembles a slum safari rather than immersive journalism, as the reporters and cameramen travel safely around West Point in their car. This suggests that these stories are not so much based in ‘reality’, but rather they are a construction made out of the inter-subjectivity of the filmmakers (ibid). Viewing their ‘journalism’ more critically, it could be said that it actually more resembles a modern version of a colonial travel diary. I would only disagree with Kalvø in the sense that VICE does indeed interest itself in the aesthetics of gore, sex, and violence over meaningful journalism. However, he is correct in stating that they are “rather trying to capture human attitudes and behavior to address some fundamental questions in social history in a faster, some would say, shallower way.”</p><p>    Perhaps in an attempt to address this criticism, Shane Smith is quoted saying: “We have been accused of being subjective, and yes we are subjective. It’s almost impossible to be objective when you’re going from New York into sub-Saharan Africa into a conflict and saying ‘well I am going to be completely objective’. I don’t think that’s possible” (Riordian). Smith’s subjectivity might be read by some as the sign of a “bleeding-heart liberal,” but this subjectivity nonetheless influences the stories that VICE’s audience consumes. On many occasions, VICE has been criticized as subjective stunt television that lacks the context necessary for the pressing issues that they cover. Alexander Kaufman of the Huffington Post summarized some of the questions being asked of Vice: “Wasn’t this just a stunt, sending Dennis Rodman to North Korea? Could you really count this as journalism? Do you think it’s cool to exploit the plight of North Koreans? Aren’t you guys just a bunch of hard-drinking hipsters from Williamsburg?” (ibid). Working at VICE however, is not as carefree as it seems, as many its employees have complained about not receiving fair wages (Nolan). One of their journalists, named Mohammed Ismael Rasool, has even been imprisoned by the Turkish government (Hanrahan). Still, one has to wonder if VICE’s journalists, particularly the white males, are privileged over local journalists who simply wished they had the opportunity to tell their own peoples’ narratives.</p><p>    In conclusion, the deregulation of digital media has not allowed subaltern societies to control their own narratives, but rather it has led to the proliferation of digital news outlets that serve corporate, neocolonial interests. As one scholar notes: “The combination of neoliberalism and corporate media culture tends to promote a deep and profound depoliticization. One need only look at the United States to see the logical endpoint” (McChesney). The narratives of subaltern societies are at once decontextualized from their traumatic histories with the West and recontexualized to serve the purposes of Western hegemony. To quote Arundhati Roy: “There's really no such thing as the 'voiceless'. There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.”</p><hr><p><b>Annotated Bibliography</b></p><ol><li><a href="http://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_18_October_2011/14.pdf">Eijaz, Abida, and Ahmad, Rana Eijaz. "Challenges of Media Globalization for Developing Countries."</a> <i>International Journal of Business and Social Science </i>2.18 (2011): 100-105. This paper looks at how technology has facilitated the expansion of the political economy of mass media to a global scale. Specifically, it addresses the effect of media globalization on the dissemination of information, by claiming that those of higher socioeconomic status in core countries have more access to information than those of lower socioeconomic status in semi/peripheral nations. The paper is based on information taken from the United Nations and prominent scholars in the field of mass communications. The authors are assistant professors in communication studies and political science at the University of the Punjab Lahore in Pakistan. This paper provides ample background on the mechanisms of media globalization and it supports my thesis that the subjectivities of those of marginal status have been decentered as a result of digital media.</li><li>hooks, bell. <i>Black looks: race and representation. </i>Boston: South End, 1992.

This book challenges the idea that a raceless and "utopian" Internet exists by presenting the concept of cybertypes: the ways in which the Internet circulates and commodifies images of race and racism. The book uses visual cultural studies to make critical observations and analyses of online media. The author is a pioneering scholar in the examination of race in digital media, and throughout the book she cites prominent thinkers in the fields of feminism and social activism. Concepts such as cybernetic tourism are crucial to understand how users navigate the web.

This book examines how liberal democracies have incorporated queer subjects into the state through state-sanctioned rights, such as the legalization of gay marriage as well as representation in the media. It suggests that Western countries have adopted a new hegemonic practice known as homonationalism in order to enforce a homonormative standard for countries with queer communities worldwide. The book is based on queer theory, transnational feminism, Foucauldian biopolitics, and Deleuzian philosophy, as well as queer media and ethnographic data. The author is a US-based queer theorist and an associate professor of Women's &amp; Gender Studies at Rutgers University. Her concept of homonationalism is essential to understanding how subaltern societies are framed in VICE Media.</li><li><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Accuracy,%20independence,%20impartiality-%20Look%20at%20legacy%20and%20digital%20natives.pdf">Riordan, Kellie. "Accuracy, independence, and impartiality: How legacy media and digital natives approach standards in the digital age." Reuters Institute at University of Oxford, 2014. </a>This paper examines how the principles of accuracy, independence, and impartiality are approached in digital media. Specifically, the paper focuses on three legacy organizations and three digital outlets, including Vice News. The paper is based on interviews with various scholars and representatives from both legacy and new media outlets, and it asks how traditional and new media outlets can benefit from each other to create the best of both worlds. The author is a tenured journalist, editor, and radio manager, as well as a visiting fellow at the Reuters Institute for Journalism at Oxford.
