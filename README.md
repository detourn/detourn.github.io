<b>spectacle</b> <br>
1. <i>noun</i> The organization of appearances made possible through modern means of communication (media). The ease with which images can be detached and alienated from their sources, and reorganized for re-presentation in accord with the ideology of the ruling power, forms the technical basis of the unprecedented scope of the modern spectacle, where "everything that was once directly lived has moved away into its representation". Communications of lived experience become communications of (and about) spectacles, communication of passivity, non-communication. The spectacle in general names the ensemble of the social relations of non-communication, of isolation. Real means of communication would be means to dialogue as opposed to the technologies of "unilogue" which have developed with the spectacle.<br><br> Unilateral, one-way communication is always authoritarian: the giving of orders.

<h3>[a]bout unilogue</h3>
  this site was originally created as an aesthetical experiment to compliment my undergraduate work. however, as my interest in the digital humanities has grown, it has evolved into a space for some of my favorite projects dealing with visual sociology, urban politics + semiotics, and postmodern philosophy.
  
  if you have a project (i.e. 3.js/GIS/Twine experiment) that you want featured, or just like the layout of my site and would like to use it for your own project, i'd be glad to help! send me an email @ <a href="mailto:unilogue.io@gmail.com">unilogue [dot] io [at] gmail [dot] com</a>
