<h2>unilogue</h2>

<b>spectacle</b> 
1. noun

The organization of appearances made possible through modern means of communication (media). The ease with which images can be detached and alienated from their sources, and reorganized for re-presentation in accord with the ideology of the ruling power, forms the technical basis of the unprecedented scope of the modern spectacle, where "everything that was once directly lived has moved away into its representation". Communications of lived experience become communications of (and about) spectacles, communication of passivity, non-communication. The spectacle in general names the ensemble of the social relations of non-communication, of isolation. Real means of communication would be means to dialogue as opposed to the technologies of "unilogue" which have developed with the spectacle. Unilateral, one-way communication is always authoritarian: the giving of orders. The nightmare of the spectacle, of images which take on a "life" of their own, is fully realized when people consciously attempt to live up to the images with which they are presented: even in lovemaking, potentially the most perfect form of communication (the unity of pleasure-giving and pleasure-getting), human beings are constantly trying to present images of themselves to each other -- "stud", "sensuous woman", etc. -- the immediate contact of two human beings is lost in the pseudo-lovemaking of their spectacular images. The spectacle, in its various forms, rules the world: the world which it re-presents as its world.
The materialization of ideology.
AÂ set of social relations mediated by images and representations. Â  It hides more than it shows.
