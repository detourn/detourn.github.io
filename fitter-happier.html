    <h2>fitter happier</h2>
    <div id="example1">
    
Fitter, happier, more productive<br />
Comfortable, not drinking too much<br />
Regular exercise at the gym 3 days a week<br />
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries<br />
<br />
At ease, eating well<br />
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats<br />
A patient better driver, a safer car, baby smiling in back seat<br />
Sleeping well, no bad dreams, no paranoia<br />
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole<br />
<br />
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then<br />
Will frequently check credit at Moral Bank hole in wall<br />
Favors for favors, fond but not in love<br />
Charity, standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket<br />
<br />
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants<br />
Car wash also on Sundays<br />
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows<br />
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate<br />
Nothing so childish<br />
<br />
At a better pace, slower and more calculated<br />
No chance of escape, now self-employed<br />
Concerned but powerless<br />
An empowered and informed member of society<br />
<br />
Pragmatism, not idealism<br />
Will not cry in public<br />
Less chance of illness<br />
Tires that grip in the wet<br />
Shot of baby strapped in back seat<br />
A good memory<br />
<br />
Still cries at a good film<br />
Still kisses with saliva<br />
No longer empty and frantic<br />
Like a cat tied to a stick<br />
That's driven into frozen winter shit<br />
<br />
The ability to laugh at weakness<br />
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive<br />
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
